Create a script to demonstrate the visibility of variables and when they 
are available within a script and its functions. Define a global variable, 
a function that defines a local variable and then display both BEFORE calling the function, 
call the function, then display both AFTER calling the function.

#!/bin/bash
#Attempts to count number of lines of any command
#nameof the script : count_pp

declare -i count=0

cunt_lines () {
          while read -r; do
             ((++count))
          done
         echo $count
}

$* | count_lines 
echo $count

output :

/home/rsirigi/count_pp ls
